    """
    Function that takes in the current belief tuple, parameters, possible failures and system to determine the next best action to take.
    Uses the SFEAST algorithm

    Parameters
    ----------
    beliefTuple : tuple
        The belief is represented by an array of failureWeights and the filter array corresponding to each possibleFailure. Contains:
            failureWeights : array, shape(maxPossibleFailures)
                Normalized weighting of the relative likelihood of each failure
            filters : array
                Array of conditional filters on the physical state
    solverParametersTuple : tuple
        List of solver parameters needed. Contents are:
            availableActions : array, shape(maxNumActions,numAct)
                Array of actions that can be taken. First action is always null action
            discretization : float
                Discretization level or scheme
    possibleFailures : array, shape(maxPossibleFailures,numAct+numSen)
        Array of possible failures to be considered by the solver. If not exhaustive, these are a random subset. Belief failure weights are are over these possibilities
    systemF : function
        Function reference of the system to call to run experiment. Not used here, but provided to make compatible with marginal filter
    systemParametersTuple : tuple
        Tuple of system parameters needed. See the model being used for details. (ie, linearModel)
        Abstracted for the system function
    rewardF : function
        Reward function to evaluate the beliefs with
    estimatorF : function
        Estimator function to update the beliefs with. Takes batch of filters
    physicalStateSubEstimatorF : function
        Function to update all of the conditional position filters
    physicalStateJacobianF : function
        Jacobian of the model for use in estimating.
    physicalStateSubEstimatorSampleF : function
        Samples from the belief corresponding to this estimator
    nSimulationsPerTree : int
        Number of max simulations per tree for the solver to search
    rngKey : JAX PRNG key
        Key for the PRNG, to be used to create pseudorandomness

    Returns
    -------
    action : array, shape(numAct)
        Action to take next
    rootNode : BeliefNode
        Root node of the tree that is now expanded to amount requested (N trajectories)
