    ----------
    physicalState : array, shape(numState)
        Physical state of the system to evaluate constraints against.
        NOTE: Assumed to be a double integrator state, so for example, we have x, vx, y, vy, ...

        Radius of obstacle AND the spacecraft. This is because this is the closest the centers can come to each other.

    Taylor expansion of the dynamics

    C = difference between non-linear and linearized dynamics. xdot = f(x,u) = Ax + Bu + C. Used for "virtual control" to provide a non-linear correction, I think.

    Parameters
    ----------
    systemParametersTuple : tuple
        Tuple of system parameters needed. Assumed to be 3DOF nonlinear system
        Contents are in order:
            positionInfluenceMatrix : array, shape(2, numThrusters)
                Bp matrix. Influence of the thrusters on the position scaled by mass. We choose to break these out so we can deal with rotation of body frame
            rotationInfluenceMatrix : array, shape(numThrusters)
                Br matrix. Influence of the thrusters on the rotation scaled by moment. We choose to break these out so we can deal with rotation of body frame
            reactionWheelInfluenceMatrix : array, shape(numWheels)
                G*Jw matrix. Influence of reaction wheels on the rotation (they don't affect position). We choose to break these out so we can deal with rotation of body frame and stored momentum.
                For 3DOF this is just the ones array
            positionCoefficientOfFriction : float
                Coefficient of friction that would be in the Ap matrix. Each axis is assumed to be the same coefficient of friction
            rotationalCoefficientOfFriction : float
                Coefficient of friction that would be in the Ar matrix. Since this can vary independent of the position coefficient (for example, based on pad spacing) as it yields a torque,
                we report it separately. We could instead deal with the lever arms, but this is easier and more robust
            sensingMatrix : array, shape(numSen, numState)
                C matrix
            dt : float
